### Product Pitch

**Waterwize: A Tool for Exploring the Correlation Between Air Quality, Water Quality, and Industrial Wastewater**

Water is important. Everybody cares about the quality of our natural water sources to some degree or another, whether they worry about our drinking water sources, the many, rich aquatic ecosystems, or just dislike their local water bodies being dirty and smelly as see them day-to-day. However, the question of what makes up or detracts from "good water quality" in our natural bodies of water is not trivial to answer and the question of "what causes water quality to increase or decrease" is an incredibly complex one. With Waterwize, we provide a starting point for answering this important and complex question in the form of a tool that allows you to explore the correlation between air quality, waste water, and water quality. Waterwize will allow deep customization of it's correlation visualizations, along with providing both intuitive and technically detailed presentations of these correlations so that users from all backgrounds can use it learn about what affects the quality of their water.

### Project Description
Waterwize is a web appplication that allows users to view customizable visualizations of the correlation between air quality, waste-water, and water quality. It will display a visualization of the correlation between these factors, statistics about their relationship, as well as other more intuitive presentation of the same data used to measure these relationships, such as rankings of locations based on these factors and map based graphics of how geographic regions' air, water, and waste-water differ.

**Problem Statement**
Water quality is a universally impactful to people's quality of life. While most major decisions affecting water quality will be made by large organizations, individuals still need more information about their local water quality beyond a general impression of it being "good" or "bad" if they are going to engage in activism, and generally make informed decisions. Waterwize will be a starting point that indivduals can take to begin learning more about what is affecting their local (as well as other) water sources and how it is doing so.

**Target Users**
Individuals (i.e. not organizations), who are adults of any education level, who want to learn more about what affects water quality in various bodies of water.

**App Scope**
Waterwize is centered around the informing the average person about water quality and factors which affect it. As such, it will not involve very technical descriptions or analyses and will not perform much functionality outside the goal of being a helpful source of information for its users.
